This file is intended for Tailwind CSS directives.
Due to current npm environment issues, Tailwind CSS is not being processed.
The actual styles are currently served from owner.css and consumer.css.
Once npm is functional, running 'npm run build:css' (or similar)
will generate 'dist/output.css' from this file.
